# logical-clocks
We are building models of asynchronous distributed systems to experiment on multiple implementations of logical clocks.

## Design Process
To understand our design decisions and follow our progress, please check our lab notebooks. We have two lab notebooks - one in the Python folder and one in the C folder. Temporally, the Python lab notebook was written before the C lab notebook.
